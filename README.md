# HitchHike: Redefining Mobility for Todayâ€™s Student Traveler

Whether you're planning your journey ahead of time or looking for a last-minute ride, HitchHike connects you with the perfect travel solutions, right at your fingertips.

## Empowering Your Journey

HitchHike sprang from a clear need among UC Davis students for a more affordable travel option to the Bay Area, beyond the costly taxis or public transportation.
